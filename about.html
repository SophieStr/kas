    <h1> About KAS </h1>

    <p> 1. Twice baked. The word 'Biscuit' comes from the Latin words 'Bis' meaning twice, and 'Coctus', which means baked – the sweet snack used to be cooked at least twice, but today they usually just get cooked the once. Biscuits used to be popular with sea explorers as they stayed fresh for so long, forming part of the staple diet for sea voyagers.<br></p>

<p>2. You've been eating them upside down all this time. Breaking biscuit news shook the biscuit world earlier this year when fans of the treat found out that they had been happily tucking into their digestives for years, blissfully unaware that... they'd actually been eating them upside down all along! McVities recently dropped the bombshell that Chocolate Digestives have the chocolate at the bottom of the biscuit, not the top. To find out more about this shocking news, visit independent.co.uk/news/weird-news<br></p>

<p>3. Biscuit spread exists. The Cookery team's Charlie loves to tuck into a snack of sliced apple along with a dollop of Lotus Biscuit Spread, available at Waitrose.<br></p>

<p>4. Biscuit eating is a dangerous sport. A 2009 study revealed that 25 million people in Britain had been injured by biscuits, a lot of incidents occured when victims had been fishing for reminants of their biscuits in a scalding cup of tea. The most risky biscuit of all was The Custard Cream – so be careful if you've got a pack lurking in the cupboard.<br></p>

<p>5. American biscuits – different to UK biscuits! If you're hopping across the pond, make sure you're in the know about US-style biscuits to avoid any confusion. Ask for a biscuit in America and you'll get a 'quick bread' resembling more of a soft British scone than a crunchy biscuit – these are often savoury and eaten for breakfast. Delicious all the same, but not quite the same thing. Intrigued? Try some American-style biscuits from the US Good Housekeeping website.<br></p>
