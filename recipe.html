  <h1><a id=“digestive”>Digestive Biscuits</a></h1>

    <h3>Reviews</h3>
        <p>"Good"</p>
    <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <h5>Makes 8 to 10 medium-sized biscuits</h5>

        <h6>Ingredients:</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>75g cold butter</li>
              <li>100g wholemeal plain flour</li>
              <li>65g fine or medium oatmeal</li>
              <li>¼ teaspoon bicarbonate of soda</li>
              <li>1 to 2 tablespoons of milk (dairy, almond or soya all work well)</li>
              <li>Optional: melted chocolate or royal icing to dip</li>
              <li>Optional toppings could include: finely chopped nuts, poppy or other types of seeds, dried fruit, coloured sugar, almond flakes, stem ginger</li>
            </ul>

        <h6>Instructions:</h6>
            <ol>
            <li>Using a large bowl and your fingertips, scrunch up the butter, flour and oatmeal until you have a breadcrumb-like consistency.</li>

            <li>Add in the bicarbonate of soda and sugar and mix a little to combine.</li>

            <li>Add in 1 tablespoon of milk and try to bring the mixture together to form a dough using your hands. You may need to add in a little more milk to bring it together into one big lump – you’re looking for a dough that sticks together, but doesn’t stick all over your hands.</li>

            <li>Squidge and squeeze the dough into a nice thick slab, and sandwich it between two sheets of cling film – use a rolling pin to roll out to about 2cm thick, and chill for at least 30 minutes.</li>

            <li>When the dough is cold, roll it out onto a floured surface to about 1cm thick. If you’re a newbie, try rolling maybe one-third of your dough out first, keeping the rest in the fridge – it’ll be an easier amount to handle.</li>

            <li>Using a straight edged cookie cutter, or the rim of a small mug or glass (carefully), cut as many rounds as you can from the dough and pop them onto a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper.</li>

            <li>Emboss some of the biscuit tops if you like – I used the blunt side of a butter knife, the barrel of a pen that I’d removed the inky bit from, a clean fish slice, the bottom of a posh crystal glass and the cooling rack from my kitchen to press shapes into the dough – try for a few different shapes if you can.</li>

            <li>Put your baking tray back into the fridge to chill for 20 minutes while you preheat your oven to 170°C/325ºF/gas 3.</li>

            <li>Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the edges start to turn golden brown.</li>

            <li>Once cooled, if you’re feeling creative, you can dip some of your biscuits into melted chocolate or coloured royal icing, then sprinkle with nuts and seeds for an extra jazzy design.</li>
          </ol>

  <h3>Recipe</h3>

      <h5>Makes 12 servings</h5>

          <h6>Ingredients:</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>300 grams all-purpose flour (plus extra for rolling out)</li>
                <li>65 grams caster sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt (sea salt flakes or kosher)</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>4 ounces/125 grams butter (very cold)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup double cream</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1 egg yolk</li>
                <li>1 vanilla pod (seeds removed or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract)</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons jam (see note below)</li>
                <li>Garnish: icing sugar to decorate</li>
            </ul>


          <h6>Instructions:</h6>
              <ol>
                  <li>Place the flour, sugar, salt and baking powder into the bowl of a food processor. Chop the cold butter into small pieces and add to the processor. Pulse several times until the mixture resembles fine sand.</li>

                  <li>Lightly whisk the cream with the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla seeds. With the food processor running, slowly pour the egg and cream mixture through the top funnel. Stop as soon as the mixture comes together.</li>

                  <li>Tip the dough onto a lightly floured worktop and gently bring the pastry together into a ball.</li>

                  <li>Wrap the pastry in plastic wrap and leave to rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes and anything up to 24 hours. </li>

                  <li>Before cooking heat the oven to 160C / 325F / Gas 4.</li>

                  <li>Once the pastry has rested, take from the fridge and leave it to come to room temperature for about 15 minutes. </li>

                  <li>Heavily dust the work surface with plain / all purpose flour. Roll out the pastry to ½ cm thickness. </li>

                  <li>Using a 5cm / 2" plain cutter (you can use fluted if you want to ring the changes) cut as many biscuits as possible, you should be able to make at least 2 dozen.</li>

                  <li>Into half of the pastry biscuits, cut out a small 1/2 cm hole from the center.</li>

                  <li>Lay the biscuits both with and without holes onto a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper or baking parchment (you may need to do this in batches depending on the size of your tray).</li>

                  <li>Cook in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes until lightly golden but no more.</li>

                  <li>Remove from the oven and leave to cool completely. </li>
